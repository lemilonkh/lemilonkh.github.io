A wizard must be defeated in the the deep depths of the sea. Travel though an abandoned underwater city made of randomly generated rooms and floors you have to travel down. Each floor contains dangerous aquatic creatures that you and your trusty knife must get through by slashing enemies and grappling around to avoid their attacks. At the bottom of each biome a fearsome creature will block your way that you must defeat. Should you fail, you'll possess a new vessel to try and try again.

[![Available on itch.io](/assets/icons/itchio-badge.svg){: width="300" }](https://alghost.itch.io/ufo-no)

Aliens have invaded Earth! Millions have been kidnapped via U.F.O. and experimented on, with no end to the madness, installing cybernetics and otherworldly appendages on the humans, just to see what would happen.

One crafty prisoner was able to escape its UFO, and snags a large alien egg with them, hoping to trade it for an escape pod. But they'll need to work together with other escapees if they want to have a shot at this.

Exclusively on PlayDate, use the crank to run and dodge obstacles, while passing the egg to other nearby escapees before getting captured!

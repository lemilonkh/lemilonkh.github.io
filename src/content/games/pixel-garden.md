### Items

| <div style="width: 150px">Item</div> | Function |
|:----:|----------|
Watering can | Use on dry soil to water it and make plants grow. Can be filled up again by using it on water tiles.
Hoe | Use on grass tiles to turn them into soil tiles. Breaks after 4 uses. Can be grown using Hoeplant seeds.
Pot | Use grown plants on it to add them to the cooked recipe. Can be placed next to a fire to make it cook. Take it off the fire when the exclaimating mark appears, otherwise it will start to burn after a while and the ingredients are gone! Can be grown using Potted Plant seeds.
Fire | Can be started by using a grown Jalaburno plant on the floor. Can heat up pots and other items. Increase the heat (and duration) by placing another Jalaburno next to it.
Vending machine | Interact with it to pay the price shown above it and receive a seed for the plant shown in its window. The offered plants change from time to time, make sure to come back regularly.
Guest | Guests will ask for a specific recipe. Cook it for them and interact with them while holding the pot/ plate with it to get the amount of coins they are offering.
Snail | Will try to eat your precious plants! It doesn't like being hit by a thrown Chilly or Jalaburno. Also you can push it away temporarily to prevent it from finishing to eat a plant.
